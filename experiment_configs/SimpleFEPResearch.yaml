# Research topic focusing on the Free Energy Principle
research-topic: "Your goal is to develop a concise literature review and synthesis on the Free Energy Principle (FEP). Review two key papers on the topic and create a well-formatted, short review paper that explains the core concepts of FEP, its theoretical foundations, and its applications in cognitive science and neuroscience. The review should be accessible to readers with basic knowledge of computational neuroscience, include relevant mathematical formulations, and highlight key insights and limitations of the Free Energy Principle."
