research-topic: "Your goal is to develop a comprehensive literature review and analytical synthesis on multiagent Active Inference as a theoretical framework for understanding ant colony behaviors. The review should explore how nestmate ants could be conceptualized as active inference agents with their own generative models, perception-action cycles, and how collective behaviors might emerge from local interactions. The analysis should cover theoretical formulations of how Variational Free Energy (for perception) and Expected Free Energy (for action selection) could explain foraging, nest-building, and defense behaviors in ant colonies. The work should be mathematically rigorous with detailed theoretical formulations and demonstrate how collective intelligence could emerge from individual active inference processes. Do not write code, just long research review and math"
