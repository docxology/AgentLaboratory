research-topic: "Your goal is to develop a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that implements Active Inference with Variational Free Energy (for sensemaking) and Expected Free Energy (for action selection). The POMDP should model a room's thermal homeostat with 3 control states (cool, nothing, heat), 5 latent states for room temperature, and an observation space with 10 discrete levels (cold to hot). The implementation should be mathematically rigorous and include both theoretical formulations and practical code."
