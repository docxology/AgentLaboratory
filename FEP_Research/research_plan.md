# Research Plan for Free Energy Principle Review

## Phase 1: Literature Selection and Review
**Timeline: Days 1-3**
- Select two key papers on the Free Energy Principle from the suggestions in `key_papers.md`
- Download the papers and save them in the `/literature` folder
- Read and annotate the selected papers
- Extract core concepts, mathematical formulations, and applications

## Phase 2: Concept Synthesis
**Timeline: Days 4-5**
- Identify common themes and concepts across the papers
- Synthesize the mathematical foundations into accessible formulations
- Map out the theoretical framework and its connections to other theories
- Identify key applications and limitations discussed in the literature

## Phase 3: Paper Structure and Planning
**Timeline: Day 6**
- Refine the paper outline based on the template
- Plan each section with key points to address
- Determine which mathematical formulations to include and how to present them
- Identify any gaps in understanding that need to be addressed

## Phase 4: Paper Writing
**Timeline: Days 7-9**
- Write the first draft following the structure in `paper_template.tex`
- Focus on making concepts accessible to readers with basic knowledge
- Include clear explanations of mathematical formulations
- Ensure balanced presentation of strengths and limitations
- Compile comprehensive bibliography

## Phase 5: Revision and Finalization
**Timeline: Day 10**
- Review the draft for clarity, accuracy, and accessibility
- Refine mathematical explanations
- Ensure the paper meets the 3,000-5,000 word target
- Finalize formatting and references
- Compile the LaTeX document

## Deliverables
1. Annotated bibliography of reviewed papers
2. Complete review paper in both LaTeX (.tex) and PDF formats
3. Summary of key findings and insights

## Key Concepts to Address
- Bayesian brain hypothesis
- Variational free energy
- Active inference
- Predictive coding
- Self-organization and homeostasis
- Applications in neuroscience and psychiatry
- Theoretical and empirical limitations

## Accessibility Guidelines
- Define all technical terms when first introduced
- Provide intuitive explanations alongside mathematical formulations
- Use examples to illustrate abstract concepts
- Include visualizations where helpful
- Connect theoretical concepts to practical applications
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
