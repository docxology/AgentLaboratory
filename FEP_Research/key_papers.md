# Key Papers on the Free Energy Principle

This document suggests influential papers that could be reviewed for the FEP research project:

## Primary Papers (Suggested for Review)

1. **Friston, K. (2010). The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?** *Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 11(2), 127-138.*
   - This seminal paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Free Energy Principle as a unifying theory for understanding brain function.
   - It covers the mathematical foundations and links to predictive coding and Bayesian inference.

2. **Friston, K., Kilner, J., & Harrison, L. (2006). A free energy principle for the brain.** *Journal of Physiology-Paris, 100(1-3), 70-87.*
   - This earlier paper establishes the core theoretical framework of the Free Energy Principle.
   - It explains how the brain might minimize free energy through action and perception.

## Additional Important Papers

3. **Friston, K. J., Daunizeau, J., Kilner, J., & Kiebel, S. J. (2010). Action and behavior: a free-energy formulation.** *Biological Cybernetics, 102(3), 227-260.*
   - Extends the FEP to include active inference and discusses its implications for behavior.

4. **Parr, T., & Friston, K. J. (2019). Generalised free energy and active inference.** *Biological Cybernetics, 113(5), 495-513.*
   - A more recent elaboration that develops the mathematical formalism further.

5. **Hohwy, J. (2013). The predictive mind.** *Oxford University Press.*
   - Provides a philosophical perspective on the FEP and related predictive processing framework.

6. **Seth, A. K. (2014). The cybernetic Bayesian brain: from interoceptive inference to sensorimotor contingencies.** *In Open MIND. MIND Group.*
   - Connects the FEP to interoception and consciousness.

## Critical Perspectives

7. **Colombo, M., & Wright, C. (2018). First principles in the life sciences: the free-energy principle, organicism, and mechanism.** *Synthese, 1-26.*
   - Offers critical perspectives on the FEP as a first principle in neuroscience.

8. **Bruineberg, J., Kiverstein, J., & Rietveld, E. (2018). The anticipating brain is not a scientist: the free-energy principle from an ecological-enactive perspective.** *Synthese, 195(6), 2417-2444.*
   - Provides an alternative interpretation of the FEP from an ecological-enactive perspective.
