# Free Energy Principle Research Project

This folder contains all files related to the Free Energy Principle (FEP) research project.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a concise literature review and synthesis on the Free Energy Principle (FEP). The research involves:

1. Reviewing two key papers on the Free Energy Principle
2. Creating a well-formatted, short review paper that explains:
   - Core concepts of FEP
   - Theoretical foundations
   - Applications in cognitive science and neuroscience
   - Key insights and limitations

## Project Structure

- `SimpleFEPResearch.yaml` - Configuration file for the research project
- `/literature` - Contains the selected papers for review
- `/output` - Contains the generated review paper and any supplementary materials

## Research Objectives

The final review paper will:
- Be accessible to readers with basic knowledge of computational neuroscience
- Include relevant mathematical formulations
- Provide clear explanations of concepts like variational free energy, active inference, and predictive coding
- Present balanced perspectives on the strengths and limitations of FEP
- Include appropriate citations and a comprehensive bibliography

All research outputs will be saved within this folder.
