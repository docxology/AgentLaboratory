### RESEARCH PHASE: RUNNING EXPERIMENTS INTEGRATION

#### 1. OBJECTIVE
The primary goal of this phase is to validate the POMDP framework for thermal homeostasis by conducting simulations that assess the model's effectiveness in managing indoor temperature. This involves evaluating the modelâ€™s performance in maintaining occupant comfort while minimizing energy consumption.

#### 2. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The experiments will be structured to evaluate the following key aspects of the POMDP framework:

- **State Estimation**: Assess how accurately the model can estimate latent states (room temperature) based on noisy observations.
- **Action Selection**: Analyze the model's ability to select actions (cool, nothing, heat) based on Expected Free Energy (EFE) and the impact of these actions on room temperature.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure the model's performance using quantitative metrics such as:
  - Average distance from the target temperature.
  - Total energy consumption.
  - Occupant comfort levels.

#### 3. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
The experimental setup will include the following components:

- **Simulation Environment**: A simulated indoor environment that mimics real-world conditions, allowing for dynamic changes in temperature and occupant behavior.

- **Initial Conditions**: 
  - Starting latent state (e.g., comfortable temperature).
  - Initial prior distribution over latent states (uniform distribution).

- **Observation Noise**: Introduce noise in the observation process to simulate real sensor inaccuracies, modeled as Gaussian noise added to the true temperature readings.

#### 4. RUNNING SIMULATIONS
The following steps will be taken to run the simulations:

1. **Initialization**: Set up the initial prior distribution and define the current state of the environment.

2. **Simulation Loop**: For a defined number of time steps (e.g., 100 iterations):
   - Generate a noisy observation based on the current latent state.
   - Update the belief about the state using Variational Free Energy (VFE).
   - Select an action using Expected Free Energy (EFE).
   - Execute the action and update the current state based on the transition model.
   - Log the results for analysis (e.g., observations, actions taken, VFE, posterior distributions).

3. **Data Collection**: Collect data on:
   - Belief states over time.
   - Selected actions and their outcomes.
   - Energy consumption associated with each action.
   - Deviations from the target temperature.

#### 5. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
After running the simulations, the following analyses will be conducted:

- **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize:
  - The evolution of belief states over time.
  - The actions taken at each time step and their corresponding outcomes.
  - The distance from the target temperature throughout the simulation.

- **Quantitative Metrics**: Calculate and present metrics such as:
  - Average distance from the target temperature.
  - Total energy consumption over the simulation.
  - Frequency of each action taken.

- **Comparison of Conditions**: If applicable, compare the model's performance under different conditions (e.g., varying levels of observation noise, different initial states).

#### 6. EXPECTED OUTCOMES
The expected outcomes of this phase include:

- A comprehensive understanding of how well the POMDP framework can estimate latent states and select appropriate actions for thermal homeostasis.
- Insights into the trade-offs between energy efficiency and occupant comfort, providing valuable information for potential improvements in the model.
- A validated framework demonstrating the feasibility of using POMDPs for managing indoor thermal environments.

#### 7. FUTURE WORK
Based on the results of the experiments, future work may include:

- Refining the model by incorporating additional variables, such as humidity and occupancy patterns.
- Exploring reinforcement learning techniques to further enhance the decision-making process.
- Implementing the model in a real-world setting to validate its performance with actual sensor data.

### CONCLUSION
This phase of the research focuses on running experiments to validate the POMDP framework for thermal homeostasis. By systematically evaluating the model's performance under various conditions, we aim to gain insights into its effectiveness in managing indoor temperature while balancing energy consumption and occupant comfort. The findings from this phase will inform future developments and enhancements to the model.
