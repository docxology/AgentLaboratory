---

### INTEGRATED RESEARCH PLAN

#### 1. **Objective**
The primary objective of this research is to design and implement a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework that effectively manages indoor thermal environments by utilizing Variational Free Energy (VFE) for state estimation and Expected Free Energy (EFE) for action selection. This framework aims to optimize occupant comfort while minimizing energy consumption.

#### 2. **Mathematical Framework**
The mathematical framework will consist of the following components:

- **States (S):** Represent the underlying true states of the system, which are partially observable. We define five latent states representing room temperature:
  - **State 1:** Very cold
  - **State 2:** Cold
  - **State 3:** Comfortable
  - **State 4:** Warm
  - **State 5:** Very hot

- **Actions (A):** The decisions made by the agent, corresponding to the three control states:
  - **Action 1:** Cool
  - **Action 2:** Nothing
  - **Action 3:** Heat

- **Observations (O):** The quantized measurements of room temperature, represented by ten discrete observation levels:
  - **Observation 1:** Very cold
  - **Observation 2:** Cold
  - **Observation 3:** Cool
  - **Observation 4:** Slightly cool
  - **Observation 5:** Comfortable
  - **Observation 6:** Slightly warm
  - **Observation 7:** Warm
  - **Observation 8:** Hot
  - **Observation 9:** Very hot
  - **Observation 10:** Extremely hot

- **Transition Model (T):** Defines the probabilities of transitioning from one latent state to another given an action. This can be represented as a matrix \( T(s'|s,a) \), where \( s' \) is the next state, \( s \) is the current state, and \( a \) is the action taken. For example:
  \[
  T = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.1 & 0.7 & 0.2 & 0 & 0 \\  % Transition from Very Cold
  0 & 0.2 & 0.6 & 0.2 & 0 \\  % Transition from Cold
  0 & 0 & 0.3 & 0.4 & 0.3 \\  % Transition from Comfortable
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0.3 & 0.7 \\  % Transition from Warm
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0.1 & 0.9      % Transition from Very Hot
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

- **Observation Model (O):** Defines the probabilities of observing a certain observation given the current latent state, denoted as \( O(o|s) \). An example observation model could be:
  \[
  O = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.8 & 0.2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  % Very Cold
  0 & 0.7 & 0.3 & 0 & 0 \\  % Cold
  0 & 0 & 0.5 & 0.4 & 0.1 \\  % Comfortable
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0.6 & 0.4 \\  % Warm
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0.2 & 0.8      % Very Hot
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

- **Reward Function (R):** A function that provides feedback based on the action taken in a specific state, which can be defined as:
  \[
  R(s,a) = w_1 \cdot E(s,a) - w_2 \cdot D(s)
  \]
  where:
  - \( E(s,a) \) is the energy consumption associated with action \( a \) in state \( s \).
  - \( D(s) \) is the deviation from the desired comfort range.
  - \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \) are weights reflecting the importance of energy efficiency versus comfort.

#### 3. **State Estimation using Variational Free Energy (VFE)**
- **Goal:** To estimate the latent states based on the observations received.
- **Process:**
  - Define a prior distribution over the latent states, \( p(s) \).
  - Update this distribution based on observed data using Bayes' theorem, yielding the posterior \( p(s|o) \).
  - Minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximate posterior and the true posterior, which corresponds to minimizing the VFE:
  \[
  VFE = \mathbb{E}[\log p(o|s)] - D_{KL}(q(s) || p(s|o))
  \]
  where \( q(s) \) is the variational distribution.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Utilize a Variational Inference approach, such as Expectation-Maximization (EM), to iteratively optimize model parameters.

#### 4. **Action Selection using Expected Free Energy (EFE)**
- **Goal:** To select actions that minimize future uncertainty while maximizing expected rewards.
- **Process:**
  - Calculate the expected outcome of each action given the current state and observations.
  - Evaluate the uncertainty associated with the latent states and how it can be reduced through action.
  - The expected free energy can be computed as:
  \[
  EFE(a) = \sum_{s} p(s|o) \left[ R(s,a) + \beta H(p(s|o)) \right]
  \]
  where \( H(p(s|o)) \) is the entropy of the belief state, reflecting uncertainty.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Develop an algorithm that computes EFE for each possible action and selects the action that minimizes EFE.

#### 5. **Implementation Strategy**
- **Software Framework:** Utilize Python for implementation, leveraging libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations and possibly PyTorch or TensorFlow for any machine learning components.
- **Simulation Environment:** Create a simulated indoor environment to test the POMDP model, allowing for dynamic changes in temperature and occupant behavior.
- **Validation:** Conduct experiments to validate the model's performance against real-world data, comparing the effectiveness of the POMDP-based control system with traditional control strategies.

#### 6. **Expected Outcomes**
- A robust POMDP model that can effectively manage indoor thermal environments.
- Insights into the trade-offs between energy efficiency and occupant comfort in thermal control systems.
- A validated framework that can be applied to real-world scenarios, potentially leading to the development of smart home technologies.

#### 7. **Future Work**
- Explore the integration of additional variables, such as humidity and occupancy patterns, into the POMDP framework.
- Investigate the use of reinforcement learning techniques to further enhance the decision-making process in thermal homeostasis.
