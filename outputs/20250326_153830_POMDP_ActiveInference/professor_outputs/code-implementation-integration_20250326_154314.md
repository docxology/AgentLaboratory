### Explanation of the Code

1. **Enumerations**: The `ControlState`, `LatentState`, and `ObservationLevel` classes are defined using Python's `Enum` to represent the various states and actions clearly.

2. **Transition and Observation Models**: The transition model `T` and observation model `O` are defined as matrices. The transition model specifies the probabilities of moving from one latent state to another based on the action taken, while the observation model specifies the probabilities of observing different temperature levels given the current latent state.

3. **Reward Function**: The `reward_function` computes the reward based on the current state and action. It considers energy consumption and comfort deviation from the ideal state.

4. **Variational Free Energy Calculation**: The `variational_free_energy` function calculates the posterior distribution over the latent states based on the observations and computes the Variational Free Energy (VFE).

5. **Expected Free Energy Calculation**: The `expected_free_energy` function calculates the expected rewards for each action and selects the action that minimizes the expected free energy.

6. **Main Function**: The `main` function simulates the environment. It generates random observations, updates the belief about the state using VFE, selects actions based on EFE, and updates the current state.

### Expected Behavior
When you run the code, it simulates the process of estimating the latent state of the room's temperature based on observations and making decisions on whether to cool, heat, or do nothing based on the expected free energy.

### Conclusion
This implementation provides a modular and extensible framework for a POMDP-based thermal homeostasis control system. You can enhance it further by incorporating more sophisticated models, refining the reward function, or adding real sensor data for observations.

### Next Steps
- **Testing and Validation**: Run the implementation in various scenarios to validate its performance and robustness.
- **Integration with Real Sensors**: Adapt the observation generation to use real temperature sensor data.
- **Enhancements**: Consider adding more complex dynamics, such as varying energy costs or external temperature influences.

This comprehensive approach addresses the feedback received and ensures that the code is both functional and maintainable, setting a solid foundation for further development and research in thermal homeostasis using POMDPs.
