These metrics provided insight into the model's effectiveness in maintaining thermal homeostasis.\n\n### Alignment Between Results and Claims\n- Quantitative results from simulations demonstrated that the POMDP model outperformed baseline methods in maintaining thermal comfort. For instance, the model maintained a comfortable temperature 85% of the time, compared to 70% for baseline approaches, thus substantiating claims about its effectiveness.\n\n### Acknowledgment of Limitations\n- **Model Limitations**: \n  - The model makes certain assumptions regarding state and observation definitions.
