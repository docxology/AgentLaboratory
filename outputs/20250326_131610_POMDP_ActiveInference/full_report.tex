\section{Introduction}
This research addresses POMDP Implementation with Active Inference. The work was conducted using a systematic process implemented within the Agent Laboratory framework, involving multiple phases of research, development, and analysis.

The research followed these key phases:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Literature Review} - Review of existing research and methodologies
\item \textbf{Plan Formulation} - Developing the research plan and approach
\item \textbf{Data Preparation} - Preparing data and defining the experimental setup
\item \textbf{Code Implementation} - Implementing the algorithms and models
\item \textbf{Running Experiments} - Executing experiments and collecting results
\item \textbf{Results Interpretation} - Analyzing and interpreting the experimental findings
\item \textbf{Report Writing} - Compiling findings into a comprehensive report
\end{itemize}

Each phase was approached collaboratively by multiple expert agents, including research professors, engineers, and critics, to ensure comprehensive, rigorous, and technically sound results.

\section{Literature Review}

The literature review phase identified relevant research, methodologies, and findings in the field. The following summarizes the key insights from this review:

\subsection{Literature Review for POMDP in Thermal Homeostasis}

\subsubsection{Introduction}
Thermal homeostasis is a crucial aspect of maintaining comfortable indoor environments. This research explores the application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to manage thermal conditions effectively. POMDPs are particularly suited for this problem due to their ability to handle uncertainty in both the state of the environment (room temperature) and the observations available (temperature readings). The aim is to develop a model that integrates Variational Free Energy (VFE) for state estimation and Expected Free Energy (EFE) for action selection.

\subsubsection{POMDP Overview}
A POMDP is defined by the tuple $(S, A, O, T, Z, R, \gamma)$:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{States (S)}: The internal states of the system, which in this case correspond to the latent states of room temperature.
\item \textbf{Actions (A)}: The control states available to the agent, which can be categorized as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cool}: Activate cooling mechanisms to lower the room temperature.
  \item \textbf{Nothing}: Maintain current conditions without intervention.
  \item \textbf{Heat}: Activate heating mechanisms to raise the room temperature.
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Observations (O)}: The discrete temperature levels that can be observed, ranging from cold to hot (10 discrete levels).
\item \textbf{State Transition Model (T)}: The dynamics that dictate how the system transitions from one state to another based on the selected action.
\item \textbf{Observation Model (Z)}: The probability of observing a particular level given a specific state, which may include Gaussian or categorical distributions depending on the observation characteristics.
\item \textbf{Reward Function (R)}: The reward or cost associated with taking actions in specific states, which should consider metrics for comfort and energy consumption. A multi-objective reward function can be beneficial to optimize both comfort and energy usage.
\item \textbf{Discount Factor ($\gamma$)}: The choice of the discount factor should be justified based on the application. A value close to 1 favors long-term gains, while a value closer to 0 favors immediate rewards. Empirical testing can help identify the most appropriate value.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}

This section presents the implementation code for the research project, focusing on the key algorithms and methods developed.
