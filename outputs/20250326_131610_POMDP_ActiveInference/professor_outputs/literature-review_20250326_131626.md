### Literature Review for POMDP in Thermal Homeostasis

#### Introduction
Thermal homeostasis is a critical aspect of maintaining comfortable indoor environments. This research explores the application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to manage thermal conditions effectively. POMDPs are particularly suited for this problem due to their ability to handle uncertainty in both the state of the environment (room temperature) and the observations available (temperature readings). The aim is to develop a model that integrates Variational Free Energy for state estimation and Expected Free Energy for action selection.

#### POMDP Overview
A POMDP is defined by the tuple \( (S, A, O, T, Z, R, \gamma) \):
- **States (S)**: The internal states of the system, in this case, the latent states of room temperature.
- **Actions (A)**: The control states available to the agent (cool, nothing, heat).
- **Observations (O)**: The discrete temperature levels that can be observed (from cold to hot).
- **State Transition Model (T)**: The dynamics that dictate how the system transitions from one state to another based on the selected action.
- **Observation Model (Z)**: The probability of observing a certain level given a specific state.
- **Reward Function (R)**: The reward or cost associated with taking actions in particular states, which could relate to energy usage or comfort levels.
- **Discount Factor (\(\gamma\))**: The rate at which future rewards are considered worth less than immediate rewards.

#### Model Parameters
1. **Control States**: 
   - **Cool**: Activate cooling mechanisms to lower the room temperature.
   - **Nothing**: Maintain current conditions without intervention.
   - **Heat**: Activate heating mechanisms to raise the room temperature.

2. **Latent States**: 
   - **State 1**: Very Cold
   - **State 2**: Cold
   - **State 3**: Comfortable
   - **State 4**: Warm
   - **State 5**: Hot

3. **Observation Levels**:
   - **Level 1**: Very Cold
   - **Level 2**: Cold
   - **Level 3-4**: Slightly Cold to Comfortable
   - **Level 5**: Comfortable
   - **Level 6-7**: Slightly Warm to Warm
   - **Level 8**: Hot
   - **Level 9-10**: Very Hot

#### Variational Free Energy for State Estimation
Variational Free Energy (VFE) provides a principled way to estimate the hidden states of the system. It operates by minimizing the difference between the true posterior distribution of the states given the observations and a variational approximation of this posterior. The key steps include:
1. **Modeling the Prior**: Establish a prior belief about the distribution of the latent states.
2. **Updating Beliefs**: Use observations to update beliefs about the latent states using Bayes' theorem.
3. **Minimizing VFE**: Adjust the variational parameters to minimize the VFE, which is defined as:
   \[
   F(q) = \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(O|S)] - D_{KL}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \]
   where \(D_{KL}\) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

#### Expected Free Energy for Action Selection
Expected Free Energy (EFE) is used to inform action selection based on the expected outcomes of actions. The goal is to choose actions that minimize the expected free energy, thereby maximizing the expected utility. The EFE can be expressed as:
\[
E[G] = \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(O|S)] - D_{KL}(q(S) || p(S|O))
\]
The selection of actions is based on the action that results in the lowest expected free energy, which balances exploration (gathering more information) and exploitation (maximizing reward).

#### Related Work
1. **POMDP Applications**: Various research works have applied POMDP frameworks to control systems, including HVAC systems, showing improvements in energy efficiency and comfort.
2. **Variational Methods**: The use of variational methods for state estimation has been explored in robotics and autonomous systems, demonstrating effective results in partially observable environments.
3. **Energy Management Systems**: The integration of expected free energy in energy management systems has been found to enhance decision-making processes in uncertain environments.

#### Conclusion
This literature review provides foundational insights into the application of POMDPs for thermal homeostasis, emphasizing the roles of Variational Free Energy for state estimation and Expected Free Energy for action selection. The careful structuring of control states, latent states, and observation levels is crucial for the model's effectiveness. The next steps in this research involve developing the mathematical formulations and computational algorithms necessary to implement this model and validate it through simulation studies.

#### Future Directions
- **Simulation Testing**: Implement the POMDP model in a simulated environment to assess performance.
- **Real-World Application**: Investigate the practical application of the model in smart home systems.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Explore methods to incorporate user preferences and feedback into the decision-making process.

This structured approach sets the stage for developing a robust model to manage thermal homeostasis effectively.
