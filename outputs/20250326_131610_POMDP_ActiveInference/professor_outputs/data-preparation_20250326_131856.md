### Research Phase: Plan Formulation for POMDP in Thermal Homeostasis

#### Research Topic
**Application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to Thermal Homeostasis**  
This research investigates the use of POMDPs to effectively manage indoor thermal conditions, leveraging advanced techniques such as Variational Free Energy (VFE) for state estimation and Expected Free Energy (EFE) for optimal action selection.

### Model Parameters
1. **Control States (A)**: 
   - **Cool**: Activate cooling systems to reduce the temperature.
   - **Nothing**: Maintain current conditions without intervention.
   - **Heat**: Activate heating systems to raise the temperature.

2. **Latent States (S)**: 
   - **State 1**: Very Cold
   - **State 2**: Cold
   - **State 3**: Comfortable
   - **State 4**: Warm
   - **State 5**: Hot

3. **Observation Levels (O)**: 
   - **Level 1**: Very Cold
   - **Level 2**: Cold
   - **Level 3**: Slightly Cold
   - **Level 4**: Comfortable
   - **Level 5**: Slightly Warm
   - **Level 6**: Warm
   - **Level 7**: Hot
   - **Level 8**: Very Hot
   - **Level 9**: Extreme Hot
   - **Level 10**: Out of Range

### Key Components of the POMDP Model

1. **State Transition Model (T)**: 
   - Defines how the system transitions between latent states based on the selected action. This can be represented as a transition matrix \( T \), where each entry \( T(s' | s, a) \) indicates the probability of transitioning from state \( s \) to state \( s' \) given action \( a \). For example, if the action is "Cool," the probability of transitioning to a colder state increases while the probability of transitioning to a hotter state decreases.

2. **Observation Model (Z)**: 
   - Specifies the likelihood of observing a particular temperature reading given the latent state. This can be modeled using a categorical distribution, where each latent state has a probability distribution over the observations. For example, if the latent state is "Comfortable," the model might assign higher probabilities to observing "Comfortable" than "Very Cold."

3. **Reward Function (R)**: 
   - Establishes the reward or cost associated with each action in a particular state. This can be structured as a multi-objective function to balance user comfort and energy consumption. A sample formulation could be:
   \[
   R(s, a) = w_c \cdot \text{Comfort}(s) - w_e \cdot \text{Energy}(a)
   \]
   where \( w_c \) and \( w_e \) are weights for comfort and energy efficiency, respectively.

4. **Discount Factor (\(\gamma\))**: 
   - Determines the importance of future rewards, influencing the agent's decision-making process between prioritizing immediate versus long-term rewards. A higher value (close to 1) encourages long-term planning, while a lower value (close to 0) favors immediate rewards.

### Variational Free Energy for State Estimation

1. **Prior Modeling**: 
   - Establish a prior distribution over the latent states, which can be uniform or informed by historical data. This prior represents the initial beliefs about the system's state before any observations are made.

2. **Belief Updating**: 
   - Utilize observations to update beliefs about the latent states using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   p(S | O) \propto p(O | S) \cdot p(S)
   \]
   Here, \( p(O | S) \) is derived from the observation model, while \( p(S) \) is the prior distribution.

3. **VFE Minimization**: 
   - The goal is to minimize the variational free energy \( F(q) \) defined as:
   \[
   F(q) = \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(O|S)] - D_{KL}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \]
   where \( D_{KL} \) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the variational distribution \( q(S) \) and the posterior \( p(S|O) \). Minimizing \( F(q) \) is achieved by adjusting the variational parameters to closely approximate the true posterior distribution.

### Expected Free Energy for Action Selection

1. **Action Evaluation**: 
   - Calculate the expected utility of each action based on the expected outcomes, incorporating the expected free energy:
   \[
   E[G] = \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(O|S)] - D_{KL}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \]
   This approach allows the agent to evaluate the effectiveness of each action based on its potential outcomes.

2. **Action Selection Strategy**: 
   - Select the action that minimizes expected free energy. The chosen action should ideally lead to states that provide the highest comfort levels while minimizing energy consumption.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Library Utilization**: 
   - Utilize established libraries such as `pomdp_py` in Python or `POMDPs.jl` in Julia, which offer tools for defining, simulating, and solving POMDPs. These libraries often include built-in methods for state estimation and action selection.

- **Simulation Environment**: 
   - Develop a simulated environment to test the proposed POMDP model under various scenarios, allowing for iterative refinement based on performance metrics.

- **Real-World Application**: 
   - Plan for the model's integration into smart home systems to ensure compatibility with existing HVAC technologies and protocols.
