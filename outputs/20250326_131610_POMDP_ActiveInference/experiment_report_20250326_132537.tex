\textbackslash{}subsubsection\textbackslash{}{Literature Review for POMDP in Thermal Homeostasis\textbackslash{}}

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Introduction
Thermal homeostasis is a crucial aspect of maintaining comfortable indoor environments. This research explores the application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to manage thermal conditions effectively. POMDPs are particularly suited for this problem due to their ability to handle uncertainty in both the state of the environment (room temperature) and the observations available (temperature readings). The aim is to develop a model that integrates Variational Free Energy (VFE) for state estimation and Expected Free Energy (EFE) for action selection.

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# POMDP Overview
A POMDP is defined by the tuple \textbackslash{}( (S, A, O, T, Z, R, \textbackslash{}gamma) \textbackslash{}):
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **States (S)**: The internal states of the system, which in this case correspond to the latent states of room temperature.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Actions (A)**: The control states available to the agent, which can be categorized as follows:
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Cool**: Activate cooling mechanisms to lower the room temperature.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Nothing**: Maintain current conditions without intervention.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Heat**: Activate heating mechanisms to raise the room temperature.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Observations (O)**: The discrete temperature levels that can be observed, ranging from cold to hot (10 discrete levels).
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **State Transition Model (T)**: The dynamics that dictate how the system transitions from one state to another based on the selected action.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Observation Model (Z)**: The probability of observing a particular level given a specific state, which may include Gaussian or categorical distributions depending on the observation characteristics.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Reward Function (R)**: The reward or cost associated with taking actions in specific states, which should consider metrics for comfort and energy consumption. A multi-objective reward function can be beneficial to optimize both comfort and energy usage.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Discount Factor (\textbackslash{}(\textbackslash{}gamma\textbackslash{}))**: The choice of the discount factor should be justified based on the application. A value close to 1 favors long-term gains, while a value closer to 0 favors immediate rewards. Empirical testing can help identify the most appropriate value.

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Model Parameters
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{enumerate\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Control States**: 
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Cool**: Engage cooling mechanisms to lower the temperature.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Nothing**: No action is taken, maintaining the current conditions.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Heat**: Engage heating mechanisms to raise the temperature.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{enumerate\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Latent States**: 
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **State 1**: Very Cold
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **State 2**: Cold
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **State 3**: Comfortable
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **State 4**: Warm
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **State 5**: Hot
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{enumerate\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Observation Levels**:
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Level 1**: Very Cold
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Level 2**: Cold
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Levels 3-4**: Slightly Cold to Comfortable
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Level 5**: Comfortable
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Levels 6-7**: Slightly Warm to Warm
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Level 8**: Hot
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Levels 9-10**: Very Hot

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Variational Free Energy for State Estimation
Variational Free Energy (VFE) provides a principled way to estimate the hidden states of the system. It operates by minimizing the difference between the true posterior distribution of the states given the observations and a variational approximation of this posterior. The key steps include:
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{enumerate\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Modeling the Prior**: Establish a prior belief regarding the distribution of the latent states.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{enumerate\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Updating Beliefs**: Utilize observations to update beliefs about the latent states using Bayes' theorem.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{enumerate\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Minimizing VFE**: Adjust the variational parameters to minimize the VFE, defined as:
   \textbackslash{}[
   F(q) = \textbackslash{}mathbb\textbackslash{}{E\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}_\textbackslash{}{q\textbackslash{}}[\textbackslash{}log p(O|S)] - D\textbackslash{}_\textbackslash{}{KL\textbackslash{}}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \textbackslash{}]
   where \textbackslash{}(D\textbackslash{}_\textbackslash{}{KL\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Expected Free Energy for Action Selection
Expected Free Energy (EFE) informs action selection based on the expected outcomes of actions. The goal is to choose actions that minimize the expected free energy, thus maximizing the expected utility. The EFE can be expressed as:
\textbackslash{}[
E[G] = \textbackslash{}mathbb\textbackslash{}{E\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}_\textbackslash{}{q\textbackslash{}}[\textbackslash{}log p(O|S)] - D\textbackslash{}_\textbackslash{}{KL\textbackslash{}}(q(S) || p(S|O))
\textbackslash{}]
The selection of actions is based on identifying the action that results in the lowest expected free energy, balancing exploration (gathering more information) and exploitation (maximizing reward).

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Related Work
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{enumerate\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **POMDP Applications**: Various research works have applied POMDP frameworks to control systems, including HVAC systems, demonstrating enhancements in energy efficiency and comfort.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{enumerate\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Variational Methods**: The application of variational methods for state estimation has been explored in robotics and autonomous systems, yielding effective results in partially observable environments.
\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{enumerate\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Energy Management Systems**: Integrating expected free energy in energy management systems has proven beneficial in enhancing decision-making processes in uncertain environments.

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Conclusion
This literature review provides foundational insights into the application of POMDPs for thermal homeostasis, emphasizing the roles of Variational Free Energy for state estimation and Expected Free Energy for action selection. The careful structuring of control states, latent states, and observation levels is crucial for the model's effectiveness. Addressing the feedback and contributions, future work will focus on developing the mathematical formulations and computational algorithms necessary to implement this model and validate it through simulation studies.

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Future Directions

\textbackslash{}begin\textbackslash{}{itemize\textbackslash{}}
\textbackslash{}item **Real-World Application**: Investigate the practical application of the model in smart home systems.

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Key Components of the POMDP Model

1. **State Transition Model (T)**: 
   - Defines the dynamics of the system, specifying how the latent states transition based on the selected action. This model will be informed by a Markov transition matrix, where each entry \textbackslash{}( T(s' | s, a) \textbackslash{}) indicates the probability of transitioning from state \textbackslash{}( s \textbackslash{}) to state \textbackslash{}( s' \textbackslash{}) given action \textbackslash{}( a \textbackslash{}).

2. **Observation Model (Z)**: 
   - Specifies the likelihood of observing a temperature reading given a latent state, which can be modeled using a categorical distribution. For example, if the latent state is "Comfortable," the probability of observing "Comfortable" might be higher than "Very Cold."

3. **Reward Function (R)**: 
   - Establishes the reward or cost associated with each action in a particular state. This can be structured as a multi-objective function to balance comfort levels and energy consumption. For example:
     \textbackslash{}[
     R(s, a) = w\textbackslash{}_c \textbackslash{}times \textbackslash{}text\textbackslash{}{Comfort\textbackslash{}}(s) - w\textbackslash{}_e \textbackslash{}times \textbackslash{}text\textbackslash{}{Energy\textbackslash{}}(a)
     \textbackslash{}]
     where \textbackslash{}( w\textbackslash{}_c \textbackslash{}) and \textbackslash{}( w\textbackslash{}_e \textbackslash{}) are weights for comfort and energy efficiency respectively.

4. **Discount Factor (\textbackslash{}(\textbackslash{}gamma\textbackslash{}))**: 
   - Determines the importance of future rewards, impacting the agent's long-term versus short-term decision-making. A value closer to 1 emphasizes long-term rewards, while a value closer to 0 focuses on immediate rewards.

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Variational Free Energy for State Estimation

1. **Prior Modeling**: 
   - Establish a prior belief distribution over the latent states, potentially using a uniform distribution or based on historical temperature data.

2. **Belief Updating**: 
   - Utilize observations to update beliefs using Bayes' theorem:
   \textbackslash{}[
   p(S | O) \textbackslash{}propto p(O | S) \textbackslash{}cdot p(S)
   \textbackslash{}]
   where \textbackslash{}( p(O | S) \textbackslash{}) is the observation model, and \textbackslash{}( p(S) \textbackslash{}) is the prior.

3. **VFE Minimization**: 
   - The goal is to minimize the variational free energy defined as:
   \textbackslash{}[
   F(q) = \textbackslash{}mathbb\textbackslash{}{E\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}_\textbackslash{}{q\textbackslash{}}[\textbackslash{}log p(O|S)] - D\textbackslash{}_\textbackslash{}{KL\textbackslash{}}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \textbackslash{}]
   This involves tuning variational parameters to reduce the divergence between the true posterior and the approximate distribution.

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Expected Free Energy for Action Selection

1. **Action Evaluation**: 
   - Calculate the expected utility of each action based on the expected outcomes, incorporating the expected free energy:
   \textbackslash{}[
   E[G] = \textbackslash{}mathbb\textbackslash{}{E\textbackslash{}}\textbackslash{}_\textbackslash{}{q\textbackslash{}}[\textbackslash{}log p(O|S)] - D\textbackslash{}_\textbackslash{}{KL\textbackslash{}}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \textbackslash{}]
   This formulation allows for evaluating the balance between exploration (gaining information) and exploitation (maximizing rewards).

2. **Action Selection Strategy**:

This matrix captures the dynamics of the system, accounting for the stochastic nature of environmental changes.

\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}#\textbackslash{}# Observation Model (Z)
- The observation model specifies the likelihood of observing a particular temperature reading given a latent state.
