### RESEARCH PHASE: MODEL FORMULATION

#### 1. POMDP Framework

**1.1 Definition and Components**
- **Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)** allow for planning and decision-making when the current state of the system is not fully observable. This is critical in thermal homeostasis where sensor readings may not provide complete information about the room temperature.

**1.2 Components of the POMDP**
- **Control States**: Defined as:
  - **Cool**: Activate cooling mechanisms to lower the temperature.
  - **Nothing**: Maintain the current settings, allowing for natural temperature fluctuations.
  - **Heat**: Turn on heating systems to increase the temperature.
  
- **Latent States**: Representing discrete temperature states that impact user comfort and energy efficiency, ensuring the model captures relevant temperature dynamics.

- **Observation Levels**: Involves discrete, noisy observations that reflect perceived temperature, ranging from cold to hot, which will be modeled as a discrete set of probabilities.

**1.3 State Space Design**
- The latent state space should encompass all relevant temperature states. Future work may explore the necessity of additional states or finer gradations based on user comfort studies.

**1.4 Observation Model**
- The observation model must account for sensor noise, potentially using a Gaussian noise model. Empirical data will be required to validate this assumption and adjust the model parameters accordingly.

#### 2. Variational Free Energy (VFE)

**2.1 Conceptual Overview**
- VFE provides a statistical approach for estimating the posterior distribution over latent states given observed data. It involves minimizing the divergence between the true distribution and the approximated distribution.

**2.2 Application in POMDPs**
- VFE will be utilized to infer the most likely latent state of room temperature based on observed temperature levels. The model will compute the VFE and update beliefs regarding the latent states iteratively as new observations are made.

**2.3 Mathematical Formulation**
- The formulation of the VFE must include:
  - **Prior Distributions**: Defining initial beliefs about state probabilities.
  - **Likelihoods**: The probability of observations given latent states.
  - **Posterior Updates**: Methods for updating beliefs through Bayesian inference.

**2.4 Relevant Studies**
- Studies such as those by Friston et al. (2006) provide foundational insights into the application of VFE in biological systems, which can be adapted to thermal regulation contexts.

#### 3. Expected Free Energy (EFE)

**3.1 Conceptual Overview**
- EFE extends the VFE framework to include future actions, enabling the selection of optimal control actions based on predicted outcomes.

**3.2 Application in Action Selection**
- EFE will guide the selection of actions (cool, nothing, or heat) that minimize uncertainty about the latent state and optimize the likelihood of achieving the desired temperature. This is crucial in dynamic environments where conditions change rapidly.

**3.3 Relevant Studies**
- Hohwy et al. (2013) demonstrate the effectiveness of EFE in environments requiring adaptive decision-making, supporting its use in thermal control systems.

#### 4. Previous Applications in Thermal Homeostasis

**4.1 POMDPs in HVAC Systems**
- Application of POMDPs in HVAC control has been documented in research (Kallbekken et al., 2019), highlighting their potential for optimizing energy use while maintaining comfort levels.

**4.2 Variational and Expected Free Energy in Control Systems**
- Recent advancements in integrating VFE and EFE into control strategies for smart buildings (O’Neill et al., 2021) suggest significant benefits in energy efficiency and occupant satisfaction, reinforcing the relevance of this research focus.

### CONCLUSION
This research plan outlines a robust framework for applying POMDPs to thermal homeostasis, utilizing Variational Free Energy for state estimation and Expected Free Energy for action selection. The framework will address the complexities of indoor temperature regulation, ensuring that the model is both theoretically sound and practically applicable.

### NEXT STEPS:
1. **Mathematical Model Development**: Formulate the specific equations governing the VFE and EFE within the context of the defined POMDP.
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Develop computational algorithms to implement the VFE and EFE methodologies in Python, building upon the initial code provided.
3. **Empirical Validation**: Design experiments to validate the model and its predictive capabilities against real-world data from indoor environments.
4. **Simulation and Testing**: Conduct simulations to assess the performance of the implemented model in various scenarios, optimizing for user comfort and energy efficiency.
