### Research Phase: Plan Formulation for POMDP in Thermal Homeostasis

#### Research Topic
**Application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to Thermal Homeostasis**  
This research investigates the use of POMDPs to effectively manage indoor thermal conditions, leveraging advanced techniques such as Variational Free Energy (VFE) for state estimation and Expected Free Energy (EFE) for optimal action selection.

### Model Parameters
- **Control States (A)**: 
  1. **Cool**: Activate cooling systems to lower the temperature.
  2. **Nothing**: Maintain current conditions without intervention.
  3. **Heat**: Activate heating systems to raise the temperature.

- **Latent States (S)**: 
  1. **Very Cold**
  2. **Cold**
  3. **Comfortable**
  4. **Warm**
  5. **Hot**

- **Observation Levels (O)**: 
  1. **Very Cold**
  2. **Cold**
  3. **Slightly Cold**
  4. **Comfortable**
  5. **Slightly Warm**
  6. **Warm**
  7. **Hot**
  8. **Very Hot**
  9. **Extreme Hot**
  10. **Out of Range**

### Key Components of the POMDP Model

1. **State Transition Model (T)**: 
   - Defines the dynamics of the system, specifying how the latent states transition based on the selected action. This model will be informed by a Markov transition matrix, where each entry \( T(s' | s, a) \) indicates the probability of transitioning from state \( s \) to state \( s' \) given action \( a \).

2. **Observation Model (Z)**: 
   - Specifies the likelihood of observing a temperature reading given a latent state, which can be modeled using a categorical distribution. For example, if the latent state is "Comfortable," the probability of observing "Comfortable" might be higher than "Very Cold."

3. **Reward Function (R)**: 
   - Establishes the reward or cost associated with each action in a particular state. This can be structured as a multi-objective function to balance comfort levels and energy consumption. For example:
     \[
     R(s, a) = w_c \times \text{Comfort}(s) - w_e \times \text{Energy}(a)
     \]
     where \( w_c \) and \( w_e \) are weights for comfort and energy efficiency respectively.

4. **Discount Factor (\(\gamma\))**: 
   - Determines the importance of future rewards, impacting the agent's long-term versus short-term decision-making. A value closer to 1 emphasizes long-term rewards, while a value closer to 0 focuses on immediate rewards.

### Variational Free Energy for State Estimation

1. **Prior Modeling**: 
   - Establish a prior belief distribution over the latent states, potentially using a uniform distribution or based on historical temperature data.

2. **Belief Updating**: 
   - Utilize observations to update beliefs using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   p(S | O) \propto p(O | S) \cdot p(S)
   \]
   where \( p(O | S) \) is the observation model, and \( p(S) \) is the prior.

3. **VFE Minimization**: 
   - The goal is to minimize the variational free energy defined as:
   \[
   F(q) = \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(O|S)] - D_{KL}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \]
   This involves tuning variational parameters to reduce the divergence between the true posterior and the approximate distribution.

### Expected Free Energy for Action Selection

1. **Action Evaluation**: 
   - Calculate the expected utility of each action based on the expected outcomes, incorporating the expected free energy:
   \[
   E[G] = \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(O|S)] - D_{KL}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \]
   This formulation allows for evaluating the balance between exploration (gaining information) and exploitation (maximizing rewards).

2. **Action Selection Strategy**: 
   - Select the action that minimizes expected free energy. This action will ideally lead to states that provide the highest comfort and energy efficiency.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Library Utilization**: 
   - Utilize existing libraries such as `pomdp_py` or `POMDPs.jl` for defining, simulating, and solving the POMDP model. These libraries provide tools for efficient state estimation and action selection.

- **Simulation Environment**: 
   - Develop a simulation environment to test the proposed POMDP model under various scenarios, enabling iterative refinement based on performance metrics.

- **Real-World Application**: 
   - Plan for the integration of the model into smart home systems, ensuring compatibility with existing HVAC technologies.

- **User Feedback Mechanism**: 
   - Explore methods for incorporating user preferences and real-time feedback into the decision-making process, enhancing user satisfaction.
