### Research Phase: Plan Formulation for POMDP in Thermal Homeostasis

#### Research Topic
**Application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to Thermal Homeostasis**  
This research investigates the use of POMDPs to manage indoor thermal conditions, leveraging advanced techniques such as Variational Free Energy (VFE) for state estimation and Expected Free Energy (EFE) for optimal action selection.

#### Model Parameters
- **Control States (A)**: Three distinct actions that the system can take:
  1. **Cool**: Activate cooling systems to lower the temperature.
  2. **Nothing**: No action taken, maintaining current conditions.
  3. **Heat**: Activate heating systems to increase the temperature.

- **Latent States (S)**: Five internal states that represent the current thermal conditions in the environment:
  1. **Very Cold**
  2. **Cold**
  3. **Comfortable**
  4. **Warm**
  5. **Hot**

- **Observation Levels (O)**: Ten discrete observations representing temperature readings:
  1. **Very Cold**
  2. **Cold**
  3. **Slightly Cold**
  4. **Comfortable**
  5. **Slightly Warm**
  6. **Warm**
  7. **Hot**
  8. **Very Hot**
  9. **Extreme Hot**
  10. **Out of Range**

#### Key Components of the POMDP Model
1. **State Transition Model (T)**: Defines how the system transitions between latent states based on the chosen action. This can include stochastic elements to account for uncertainty.
  
2. **Observation Model (Z)**: Specifies the likelihood of observing a particular temperature reading given the latent state. This may involve a categorical distribution reflecting the discrete nature of observations.

3. **Reward Function (R)**: Establishes the reward or cost associated with each combination of action and state. Potentially, a multi-objective reward function can be formulated to balance energy use and user comfort, for example:
   - Reward for maintaining comfort levels.
   - Penalty for excessive energy consumption.

4. **Discount Factor (\(\gamma\))**: Determines the importance of future rewards. It should be chosen based on empirical testing to optimize the model's performance for the specific application.

#### Variational Free Energy for State Estimation
1. **Prior Modeling**: Define a prior belief distribution over the latent states, which could be uniform or informed by historical data.
  
2. **Belief Updating**: Use incoming observations to update beliefs about latent states through Bayes' theorem.

3. **VFE Minimization**: The goal is to adjust the variational parameters to minimize the VFE:
   \[
   F(q) = \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(O|S)] - D_{KL}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \]
   This framework allows for robust state estimation, accommodating the uncertainty inherent in the system.

#### Expected Free Energy for Action Selection
1. **Action Evaluation**: Calculate the expected utility of each action by considering both the immediate rewards and the potential for future states, incorporating the expected free energy:
   \[
   E[G] = \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(O|S)] - D_{KL}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \]
  
2. **Action Selection Strategy**: Choose the action that minimizes expected free energy, which balances exploration (gathering information) and exploitation (maximizing rewards).

#### Implementation Considerations
- **Library Utilization**: Leverage existing libraries such as `pomdp_py` or `POMDPs.jl` to facilitate the model definition, simulation, and solving of the POMDP.
  
- **Simulation Environment**: Develop a simulated environment to test the proposed POMDP model, enabling iterative refinements based on performance metrics.

- **Real-World Application**: Plan for the practical deployment of the model in smart home systems, considering integration with existing HVAC systems.

- **User Feedback Mechanism**: Explore incorporating user feedback to adjust the model dynamically, enhancing user comfort and satisfaction.

#### Related Work
1. **Applications of POMDPs**: Review related studies that utilize POMDP frameworks in HVAC and energy management, focusing on energy efficiency and comfort improvements.
  
2. **Variational Methods in Robotics**: Investigate how variational methods have been applied in robotics for state estimation in partially observable environments.

3. **Energy Management Systems**: Analyze existing systems integrating expected free energy for decision-making processes in uncertain environments, drawing parallels to thermal homeostasis.

#### Future Directions
1. **Simulation Testing**: Conduct tests in a simulated environment to evaluate the model's effectiveness and performance under various conditions.
  
2. **Field Trials**: Consider real-world experiments in smart home settings to assess how well the POMDP model translates into practical applications.

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Use insights from simulations and trials to refine model parameters, update reward structures, and improve action selection strategies.

4. **Integration of User Preferences**: Investigate how user preferences can be quantified and integrated into the model to personalize temperature control in smart homes.

### Conclusion
This research aims to develop a comprehensive POMDP model for managing thermal homeostasis using Variational Free Energy for state estimation and Expected Free Energy for action selection. The structured formulation of control states, latent states, and observation levels is critical for the model's success. The next steps involve detailed mathematical formulation, computational algorithm development, and validation through simulation studies, setting the stage for a robust thermal management system.
