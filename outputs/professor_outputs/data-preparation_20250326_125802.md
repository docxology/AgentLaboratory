### Detailed POMDP Framework for Thermal Homeostasis

#### 1. Formal Mathematical Model for the POMDP

To construct a POMDP for thermal homeostasis, we define the following elements:

1. **State Space (S)**: The latent state space \( S \) consists of 5 discrete states representing room temperatures:
   - \( S_1 \): Very Cold
   - \( S_2 \): Cold
   - \( S_3 \): Comfortable
   - \( S_4 \): Warm
   - \( S_5 \): Hot

2. **Control Actions (A)**: The control actions \( A \) are defined as:
   - \( A_1 \): Cool (activate cooling)
   - \( A_2 \): Nothing (maintain current state)
   - \( A_3 \): Heat (activate heating)

3. **Observation Space (O)**: The observation space \( O \) consists of 10 discrete levels representing perceived temperature from cold to hot:
   - \( O_1 \): Very Cold
   - \( O_2 \): Cold
   - \( O_3 \): Slightly Cold
   - \( O_4 \): Comfortable
   - \( O_5 \): Slightly Warm
   - \( O_6 \): Warm
   - \( O_7 \): Hot
   - \( O_8 \): Very Hot
   - \( O_9 \): Extreme Hot
   - \( O_{10} \): Unbearable Heat

4. **Transition Model (T)**: The transition model \( T(s'|s,a) \) describes the probability of moving to state \( s' \) given the current state \( s \) and action \( a \). This can be represented as a transition matrix \( T \) with dimensions \( |S| \times |A| \times |S| \).

5. **Observation Model (Z)**: The observation model \( Z(o|s) \) specifies the probability of observing \( o \) given the latent state \( s \). It can be represented as an observation matrix \( Z \) with dimensions \( |S| \times |O| \).

6. **Reward Function (R)**: The reward function \( R(s,a) \) provides the immediate reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \). This can be defined based on comfort levels, where higher comfort states yield higher rewards.

7. **Initial State Distribution (b)**: The initial belief over the states can be expressed as \( b(s) \), representing the prior distribution over the latent states.

#### 2. Variational Free Energy (VFE) Calculation for State Estimation

The Variational Free Energy (VFE) is calculated using the following formula:

\[
F = \mathbb{E}_{q(s|o)}[\log q(s|o)] - \mathbb{E}_{q(s|o)}[\log p(o|s)] + \mathbb{E}_{q(s|o)}[\log p(s)]
\]

Where:
- \( q(s|o) \): The variational distribution over the latent states given the observation \( o \).
- \( p(o|s) \): The likelihood of observing \( o \) given the latent state \( s \).
- \( p(s) \): The prior distribution over latent states.

**Steps to Calculate VFE**:
1. Initialize \( q(s|o) \) based on prior beliefs.
2. For each observation \( o \), update \( q(s|o) \) using the observation model \( Z(o|s) \).
3. Calculate the expected values using the current \( q(s|o) \).
4. Minimize \( F \) to refine \( q(s|o) \) iteratively until convergence.

#### 3. Expected Free Energy (EFE) Calculation for Action Selection

The Expected Free Energy (EFE) is calculated as follows:

\[
EFE(a) = \sum_{s} q(s|o) \left( R(s,a) + \sum_{s'} T(s'|s,a) \log p(o|s') \right)
\]

Where:
- \( q(s|o) \): The belief over the latent states after observing \( o \).
- \( R(s,a) \): The reward for taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
- \( T(s'|s,a) \): The transition probabilities.

**Steps to Calculate EFE**:
1. For each potential action \( a \), compute the expected reward \( R(s,a) \).
2. Estimate the transition probabilities for all subsequent states \( s' \) given the action \( a \).
3. Calculate the expected observation likelihood for each subsequent state \( s' \).
4. Select the action \( a^* \) that minimizes \( EFE(a) \).

#### 4. Thermal Homeostasis Dynamics

The thermal dynamics model can be represented as follows:

- **Temperature Transition Dynamics**:
  - The current temperature state transitions based on the control actions. For example:
    - **Cool**: Reduces the temperature by a defined amount (e.g., 2 degrees).
    - **Nothing**: Maintains the current temperature.
    - **Heat**: Increases the temperature by a defined amount (e.g., 2 degrees).

This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[
T_{new} = T_{current} + \Delta T(a)
\]
Where \( \Delta T(a) \) is a function of the action taken.

#### 5. Parameters Needed for the Model

To fully specify the POMDP for thermal homeostasis, the following parameters are needed:

1. **Transition Matrix \( T \)**: A 3D matrix defining state transitions for each action.
2. **Observation Matrix \( Z \)**: A matrix defining the probability of each observation given each state.
3. **Reward Function \( R \)**: A vector defining the rewards for each state-action pair.
4. **Initial State Distribution \( b \)**: A vector defining the initial beliefs about the states.
5. **Noise Model**: Parameters defining the noise characteristics of observations (e.g., Gaussian noise parameters).

### Conclusion

This detailed formulation presents a structured approach to implementing a POMDP for thermal homeostasis using Variational Free Energy for state estimation and Expected Free Energy for action selection. The next steps involve translating this theoretical framework into computational algorithms, followed by empirical validation and testing in real-world scenarios.
