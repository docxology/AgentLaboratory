## Research Topic
**Application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to Thermal Homeostasis**

10. **Out of Range**

## Key Components of the POMDP Model

### State Transition Model (T)
- The transition probabilities can be represented in a matrix format \( T \), with each entry \( T(s' | s, a) \) indicating the probability of transitioning from state \( s \) to state \( s' \) given action \( a \). This matrix captures the dynamics of the system, accounting for the stochastic nature of environmental changes.

### Observation Model (Z)
- The observation model specifies the likelihood of observing a particular temperature reading given a latent state. It can be modeled using a categorical distribution reflecting the discrete nature of observations. For example, if the latent state is "Comfortable," the observation model would assign higher probabilities to "Comfortable" and lower probabilities to extremes like "Very Cold."

### Reward Function (R)
- The reward function establishes the reward or cost associated with each action in a particular state. A multi-objective reward function can be used to balance user comfort and energy consumption:
   \[
   R(s, a) = w_c \cdot \text{Comfort}(s) - w_e \cdot \text{Energy}(a)
   \]
   where \( w_c \) and \( w_e \) are the weights for comfort and energy efficiency respectively.

### Discount Factor (\(\gamma\))
- The discount factor influences the importance of future rewards. A value close to 1 emphasizes long-term rewards, while a value closer to 0 focuses on immediate rewards. Empirical testing will help determine the optimal discount factor for the specific application.

## Variational Free Energy for State Estimation

### Prior Modeling
- Establish a prior distribution over the latent states, potentially using a uniform distribution or one informed by historical data. This prior represents the initial beliefs about the system's state before any observations are made.

### Belief Updating
- Utilize observations to update beliefs about the latent states using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   p(S | O) \propto p(O | S) \cdot p(S)
   \]
   where \( p(O | S) \) is derived from the observation model and \( p(S) \) is the prior distribution.

### VFE Minimization
- The goal is to minimize the variational free energy \( F(q) \):
   \[
   F(q) = \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(O|S)] - D_{KL}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \]
   where \( D_{KL} \) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the variational distribution \( q(S) \) and the posterior \( p(S|O) \).

## Expected Free Energy for Action Selection

### Action Evaluation
- Calculate the expected utility of each action based on the expected outcomes, incorporating the expected free energy:
   \[
   E[G] = \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(O|S)] - D_{KL}(q(S) || p(S|O))
   \]
   This formulation allows the agent to evaluate the effectiveness of each action based on its potential outcomes.

### Action Selection Strategy
- Select the action that minimizes expected free energy. The chosen action should ideally lead to states that provide the highest comfort levels while minimizing energy consumption.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Library Utilization**: 
   - Consider employing established libraries such as `pomdp_py` or `POMDPs.jl`, which provide built-in tools for defining, simulating, and solving POMDPs. These libraries facilitate efficient state estimation and action selection.

   - Develop a simulation environment to test the proposed POMDP model under various scenarios, enabling iterative refinements based on performance metrics.

### Code Implementation
Here's an illustrative Python code snippet showing the structure for the POMDP model:

```python
import numpy as np
from enum import Enum

class Action(Enum):
    COOL = 1
    NOTHING = 2
    HEAT = 3

class State(Enum):
    VERY_COLD = 1
    COLD = 2
    COMFORTABLE = 3
    WARM = 4
    HOT = 5

# Transition model as a NumPy array
transition_matrix = np.zeros((len(State), len(State), len(Action)))

# Example of defining transition probabilities
transition_matrix[State.VERY_COLD.value - 1, State.COLD.value - 1, Action.COOL.value - 1] = 0.8
# Define other transitions as per the model requirements

# Observation model (example probabilities)
observation_matrix = np.zeros((len(State), len(Observation)))  # Define Observation as per your observation levels

# Reward function (example)
def reward_function(state, action):
    # Implement reward logic based on state and action
    pass
```
