# Literature Review for POMDP in Thermal Homeostasis

## Introduction
Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a robust framework for decision-making under uncertainty, making them particularly suitable for applications like thermal homeostasis in indoor environments. Maintaining optimal temperature is crucial for both comfort and energy efficiency. This research focuses on implementing a POMDP model with three control states (cool, nothing, heat), five latent states representing room temperatures, and ten discrete observation levels ranging from cold to hot. This literature review integrates key concepts, relevant previous research on POMDPs, Variational Free Energy (VFE), and Expected Free Energy (EFE), as well as their applications in thermal homeostasis.

## 1. POMDP Framework

### 1.1 Definition and Components
POMDPs extend Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by incorporating hidden states that cannot be directly observed, which is essential for managing indoor temperature regulation where sensory information may be incomplete or noisy.

### 1.2 Components of the POMDP
- **Control States:** The model defines the following control states:
  - **Cool:** Engaging the cooling system to reduce room temperature.
  - **Nothing:** Maintaining the current temperature by not altering system settings.
  - **Heat:** Activating the heating system to increase room temperature.
  
- **Latent States:** The latent states represent discrete temperature levels in the room. The states can be categorized as follows:
  - **State 1:** Very cold
  - **State 2:** Cold
  - **State 3:** Comfortable
  - **State 4:** Warm
  - **State 5:** Hot
  This categorization ensures that the latent state space captures the critical variations in temperature that impact comfort and energy efficiency.

- **Observation Levels:** The model generates noisy observations that can be categorized into ten levels, indicating perceived temperature, from cold to hot. This probabilistic mapping accounts for sensor inaccuracies and environmental disturbances.

### 1.3 State Space Design
To effectively implement the POMDP for thermal homeostasis, the design of the latent state space (five discrete temperature levels) must be validated to ensure it adequately captures the granularity of temperature variations relevant to comfort and energy efficiency.

### 1.4 Observation Model
The observation model must incorporate noise and uncertainty inherent in temperature sensors. A Gaussian noise model is commonly employed; however, it is crucial to validate this assumption with empirical data to ensure reliability.

## 2. Variational Free Energy (VFE)

### 2.1 Conceptual Overview
Variational Free Energy is a principle derived from statistical mechanics and information theory, which facilitates the estimation of hidden states within a probabilistic model. It provides a means to approximate the posterior distribution over the latent states based on observed data.

### 2.2 Application in POMDPs
In the context of this research, VFE will be used to infer the most probable latent state of the room temperature given observed temperature levels. The objective is to minimize the VFE, which corresponds to finding the best estimate of the latent state that explains the observed data.

### 2.3 Mathematical Formulation
The VFE objective function must be clearly defined in terms of model parameters and observed data, specifying the prior distributions and likelihoods involved. This clarity will facilitate the implementation of the VFE in the model.

### 2.4 Relevant Studies
Friston et al. (2006) emphasize VFE's utility in modeling neural and cognitive processes, suggesting its applicability to thermal regulation challenges. Their research indicates that minimizing VFE aligns with optimizing performance in environments with uncertain sensory input.

## 3. Expected Free Energy (EFE)

### 3.1 Conceptual Overview
Expected Free Energy extends VFE into a decision-theoretic framework that evaluates future actions and their potential consequences. EFE aids in selecting actions by assessing the expected outcomes based on current beliefs about latent states.

### 3.2 Application in Action Selection
For this thermal homeostasis project, EFE will guide the selection of optimal control actions (cool, nothing, or heat) by assessing which action will minimize uncertainty regarding the latent state and maximize the likelihood of achieving the desired temperature.

### 3.3 Relevant Studies
Hohwy et al. (2013) explore the efficacy of EFE in dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for thermal control systems where adaptive and efficient responses are crucial.

## 4. Previous Applications in Thermal Homeostasis

### 4.1 POMDPs in HVAC Systems
Several studies have applied POMDPs to HVAC systems, highlighting their effectiveness in managing energy consumption while ensuring occupant comfort. Notably, Kallbekken et al. (2019) demonstrated a POMDP approach that adjusted HVAC settings based on occupancy patterns and temperature preferences, showcasing the model's practical benefits.

### 4.2 Variational and Expected Free Energy in Control Systems
Recent advancements in integrating variational methods and EFE in control systems, particularly for smart buildings, have shown significant improvements in energy efficiency and user satisfaction (O’Neill et al., 2021). These findings support the proposed methodology for thermal homeostasis.

## Conclusion
The literature indicates a solid foundation for applying POMDPs in thermal homeostasis, particularly leveraging Variational Free Energy for state estimation and Expected Free Energy for action selection. This research aims to bridge existing gaps by tailoring these methods specifically to optimize indoor thermal environments while considering control actions and latent state uncertainties. Future research should focus on empirical validation and developing practical algorithms for real-time implementation in smart home systems.
