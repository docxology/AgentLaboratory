# Final Output for Code Implementation Phase: POMDP in Thermal Homeostasis

## Introduction

This document outlines the implementation of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) for managing thermal homeostasis. The POMDP framework is suited for this application due to its ability to handle uncertainties in both system states and observations. The model integrates Variational Free Energy (VFE) for state estimation and Expected Free Energy (EFE) for action selection, providing a robust approach to maintain indoor thermal comfort effectively.

## Model Overview

### Model Parameters
- **Control States (Actions) \( A \)**:
  1. **Cool**: Activate cooling systems to reduce the temperature.
  2. **Nothing**: Maintain current conditions without intervention.
  3. **Heat**: Activate heating systems to raise the temperature.

- **Latent States \( S \)**:
  1. **Very Cold**
  2. **Cold**
  3. **Comfortable**
  4. **Warm**
  5. **Hot**

- **Observation Levels \( O \)**:
  1. **Very Cold**
  2. **Cold**
  3. **Slightly Cold**
  4. **Comfortable**
  5. **Slightly Warm**
  6. **Warm**
  7. **Hot**
  8. **Very Hot**
  9. **Extreme Hot**
  10. **Out of Range**

### Key Components of the POMDP Model

1. **State Transition Model \( T \)**: This model defines the probabilities of transitioning from one latent state to another based on the chosen action. It is represented as a 3D NumPy array.

2. **Observation Model \( Z \)**: This model specifies the probabilities of observing specific temperature readings given the latent state.

3. **Reward Function \( R \)**: This function assigns rewards for taking specific actions in particular states, aiming to balance comfort and energy efficiency.

4. **Discount Factor \( \gamma \)**: This factor is used to weigh future rewards against immediate rewards, influencing decision-making.

## Code Implementation

### Step 1: Define States and Actions

```python
import numpy as np
from enum import Enum

# Define control actions
class Action(Enum):
    COOL = 1
    NOTHING = 2
    HEAT = 3

# Define latent states
class State(Enum):
    VERY_COLD = 1
    COLD = 2
    COMFORTABLE = 3
    WARM = 4
    HOT = 5

# Define observation levels
class Observation(Enum):
    VERY_COLD = 1
    COLD = 2
    SLIGHTLY_COLD = 3
    COMFORTABLE = 4
    SLIGHTLY_WARM = 5
    WARM = 6
    HOT = 7
    VERY_HOT = 8
    EXTREME_HOT = 9
    OUT_OF_RANGE = 10
```

### Step 2: Transition Model

Initialize the transition model using a NumPy array.

```python
# Initialize transition matrix
num_states = len(State)
num_actions = len(Action)

# Transition model as a 3D NumPy array
transition_matrix = np.zeros((num_states, num_states, num_actions))

# Example of defining transition probabilities for action COOL
transition_matrix[State.VERY_COLD.value - 1, State.COLD.value - 1, Action.COOL.value - 1] = 0.8
transition_matrix[State.VERY_COLD.value - 1, State.VERY_COLD.value - 1, Action.COOL.value - 1] = 0.2
# Define other transitions similarly...
```

### Step 3: Observation Model

Define the observation model probabilities.

```python
# Initialize observation model as a NumPy array
num_observations = len(Observation)
observation_matrix = np.zeros((num_states, num_observations))

# Example probabilities for observations given states
observation_matrix[State.VERY_COLD.value - 1, Observation.VERY_COLD.value - 1] = 0.9
observation_matrix[State.VERY_COLD.value - 1, Observation.COLD.value - 1] = 0.1
# Define other observation probabilities similarly...
```

### Step 4: Reward Function

Implement the reward function.

```python
def reward_function(state: State, action: Action) -> float:
    if state == State.COMFORTABLE and action == Action.NOTHING:
        return 10  # High reward for maintaining comfort
    elif action == Action.COOL:
        return -5  # Cost for cooling
    elif action == Action.HEAT:
        return -5  # Cost for heating
    else:
        return -1  # Small penalty for other actions
```

### Step 5: Variational Free Energy Calculation

Function to compute the Variational Free Energy for state estimation.

```python
def variational_free_energy(observations: int, prior_beliefs: np.ndarray) -> float:
    log_likelihood = np.sum(np.log(observation_matrix[:, observations]))
    kl_divergence = np.sum(prior_beliefs * np.log(prior_beliefs / np.mean(prior_beliefs)))

    vfe = log_likelihood - kl_divergence
    return vfe
```

### Step 6: Expected Free Energy Calculation

Function to compute the Expected Free Energy for action selection.

```python
def expected_free_energy(current_beliefs: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    expected_rewards = np.zeros(num_actions)
    
    for action in range(num_actions):
        for next_state in range(num_states):
            expected_rewards[action] += transition_matrix[:, next_state, action] * reward_function(State(next_state + 1), Action(action + 1))
    
    return expected_rewards  # Return expected rewards for each action
```

### Step 7: Main Function to Demonstrate the Model's Behavior

The main function simulates the behavior of the POMDP model.

```python
def main():
    # Initialize prior beliefs (uniform distribution)
    prior_beliefs = np.ones(num_states) / num_states

    # Simulate some observations
    observations_sequence = [np.random.choice(num_observations) for _ in range(10)]

    for observation in observations_sequence:
        # Update beliefs using variational free energy
        vfe = variational_free_energy(observation, prior_beliefs)

        # Calculate expected free energy for action selection
        efe = expected_free_energy(prior_beliefs)

        # Select action that minimizes expected free energy
        action = np.argmin(efe)
        print(f"Action taken: {Action(action + 1).name}, Variational Free Energy: {vfe:.2f}, Expected Free Energy: {efe[action]:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Conclusion

This code provides a foundational implementation of a POMDP model for thermal homeostasis, covering essential components such as state and action definitions, transition and observation models, and reward functions. The functions for calculating Variational and Expected Free Energy are integral for state estimation and action selection.

### Future Work
- **Expand Transition and Observation Models**: Populate the transition and observation matrices with realistic probabilities informed by empirical data or domain knowledge.
- **Refine Reward Function**: Tailor the reward function to align more closely with specific comfort and energy efficiency objectives.
- **Testing and Validation**: Conduct extensive testing in simulated environments to refine model parameters and enhance performance.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code according to specific requirements and testing scenarios to ensure robust performance in real-world applications of thermal homeostasis management.
