### Comprehensive POMDP Framework for Thermal Homeostasis

#### 1. Formal Mathematical Model for the POMDP

To construct a POMDP for thermal homeostasis, we define the following elements:

1. **State Space (S)**: The latent state space \( S \) consists of 5 discrete states representing room temperatures:
   - \( S_1 \): Very Cold
   - \( S_2 \): Cold
   - \( S_3 \): Comfortable
   - \( S_4 \): Warm
   - \( S_5 \): Hot

2. **Control Actions (A)**: The control actions \( A \) are defined as:
   - \( A_1 \): Cool (activate cooling)
   - \( A_2 \): Nothing (maintain current state)
   - \( A_3 \): Heat (activate heating)

3. **Observation Space (O)**: The observation space \( O \) consists of 10 discrete levels representing perceived temperature from cold to hot:
   - \( O_1 \): Very Cold
   - \( O_2 \): Cold
   - \( O_3 \): Slightly Cold
   - \( O_4 \): Comfortable
   - \( O_5 \): Slightly Warm
   - \( O_6 \): Warm
   - \( O_7 \): Hot
   - \( O_8 \): Very Hot
   - \( O_9 \): Extreme Hot
   - \( O_{10} \): Unbearable Heat

4. **Transition Model (T)**: The transition model \( T(s'|s,a) \) describes the probability of moving to state \( s' \) given the current state \( s \) and action \( a \). This can be represented as a transition matrix \( T \) with dimensions \( |S| \times |A| \times |S| \).

5. **Observation Model (Z)**: The observation model \( Z(o|s) \) specifies the probability of observing \( o \) given the latent state \( s \). It can be represented as an observation matrix \( Z \) with dimensions \( |S| \times |O| \).

6. **Reward Function (R)**: The reward function \( R(s,a) \) provides the immediate reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \). This can be defined based on comfort levels, where higher comfort states yield higher rewards.

7. **Initial State Distribution (b)**: The initial belief over the states can be expressed as \( b(s) \), representing the prior distribution over the latent states.

#### 2. Variational Free Energy (VFE) Calculation for State Estimation

The Variational Free Energy (VFE) is calculated using the following formula:

\[
F = \mathbb{E}_{q(s|o)}[\log q(s|o)] - \mathbb{E}_{q(s|o)}[\log p(o|s)] + \mathbb{E}_{q(s|o)}[\log p(s)]
\]

Where:
- \( q(s|o) \): The variational distribution over the latent states given the observation \( o \).
- \( p(o|s) \): The likelihood of observing \( o \) given the latent state \( s \).
- \( p(s) \): The prior distribution over latent states.

**Steps to Calculate VFE**:
1. Initialize \( q(s|o) \) based on prior beliefs.
2. For each observation \( o \), update \( q(s|o) \) using the observation model \( Z(o|s) \).
3. Calculate the expected values using the current \( q(s|o) \).
4. Minimize \( F \) to refine \( q(s|o) \) iteratively until convergence.

#### 3. Expected Free Energy (EFE) Calculation for Action Selection

The Expected Free Energy (EFE) is calculated as follows:

\[
EFE(a) = \sum_{s} q(s|o) \left( R(s,a) + \sum_{s'} T(s'|s,a) \log p(o|s') \right)
\]

Where:
- \( q(s|o) \): The belief over the latent states after observing \( o \).
- \( R(s,a) \): The reward for taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
- \( T(s'|s,a) \): The transition probabilities.

**Steps to Calculate EFE**:
1. For each potential action \( a \), compute the expected reward \( R(s,a) \).
2. Estimate the transition probabilities for all subsequent states \( s' \) given the action \( a \).
3. Calculate the expected observation likelihood for each subsequent state \( s' \).
4. Select the action \( a^* \) that minimizes \( EFE(a) \).

#### 4. Thermal Homeostasis Dynamics

The thermal dynamics model can be represented as follows:

- **Temperature Transition Dynamics**:
  - The current temperature state transitions based on the control actions. For example:
    - **Cool**: Reduces the temperature by a defined amount (e.g., 2 degrees).
    - **Nothing**: Maintains the current temperature.
    - **Heat**: Increases the temperature by a defined amount (e.g., 2 degrees).

This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[
T_{new} = T_{current} + \Delta T(a)
\]
Where \( \Delta T(a) \) is a function of the action taken.

#### 5. Parameters Needed for the Model

To fully specify the POMDP for thermal homeostasis, the following parameters are needed:

1. **Transition Matrix \( T \)**: A 3D matrix defining state transitions for each action.
2. **Observation Matrix \( Z \)**: A matrix defining the probability of each observation given each state.
3. **Reward Function \( R \)**: A vector defining the rewards for each state-action pair.
4. **Initial State Distribution \( b \)**: A vector defining the initial beliefs about the states.
5. **Noise Model**: Parameters defining the noise characteristics of observations (e.g., Gaussian noise parameters).
