### Literature Review for POMDP in Thermal Homeostasis

#### Introduction
This research focuses on employing a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework to model thermal homeostasis in indoor environments. The objective is to develop a control system that effectively manages room temperature by considering various states of the environment and the uncertainties associated with them. The model parameters include three control states (cool, nothing, heat), five latent states representing room temperature, and ten discrete observation levels ranging from cold to hot. This literature review integrates technical insights and recommendations from engineering and critical feedback to enhance the robustness of the proposed model.

#### 1. Background on POMDPs
POMDPs are an extension of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that account for situations where the agent does not have full visibility of the environment's state. In thermal homeostasis, the system must make decisions based on incomplete or noisy observations of the room temperature. The key components of a POMDP include:

- **States**: The underlying true states of the system, which are partially observable.
- **Actions**: The decisions made by the agent (in this case, the control states: cool, nothing, heat).
- **Observations**: The information received from the environment (the ten discrete temperature levels).
- **Transition Model**: The probabilities of moving from one state to another given an action, which can be defined mathematically using a finite state machine representation.
- **Observation Model**: The probabilities of observing a certain observation given the current state, which requires clear definitions of noise characteristics (e.g., Gaussian, uniform).
- **Reward Function**: The feedback received after taking an action in a specific state, which should reflect both energy efficiency and occupant comfort.

#### 2. Control States
The three control states defined in the model (cool, nothing, heat) represent the agent's actions in response to the perceived temperature. Effective thermal control systems must balance energy efficiency with occupant comfort.

- **Cool**: Activating cooling systems to lower the temperature.
- **Nothing**: Maintaining the current state, which may be appropriate when the temperature is within a comfortable range.
- **Heat**: Activating heating systems to increase the temperature.

#### 3. Latent States
The five latent states represent the underlying room temperature levels, which are not directly observable. These states can be modeled as a discrete set of temperature ranges, allowing for a simplified representation of the continuous temperature spectrum.

- **State 1**: Very cold
- **State 2**: Cold
- **State 3**: Comfortable
- **State 4**: Warm
- **State 5**: Very hot

#### 4. Observation Levels
The ten discrete observation levels provide a quantized measurement of the room temperature. This discretization is essential for the POMDP framework, as it allows the agent to make decisions based on the observed temperature rather than the true latent state.

- **Observation 1**: Very cold
- **Observation 2**: Cold
- **Observation 3**: Cool
- **Observation 4**: Slightly cool
- **Observation 5**: Comfortable
- **Observation 6**: Slightly warm
- **Observation 7**: Warm
- **Observation 8**: Hot
- **Observation 9**: Very hot
- **Observation 10**: Extremely hot

#### 5. Transition and Observation Models
To enhance clarity and facilitate implementation, it is crucial to explicitly define the transition and observation models:

- **Transition Model**: This model can be represented as a matrix \( T \), where \( T(s'|s,a) \) indicates the probability of transitioning to state \( s' \) from state \( s \) given action \( a \). For example, if temperature changes linearly based on the action taken, the probabilities could be defined based on the expected temperature change rates.

- **Observation Model**: The observation model can be defined as \( O(o|s) \), where \( o \) is an observation and \( s \) is the latent state. The noise characteristics of observations should be specified, such as whether they follow a Gaussian distribution with a certain mean and variance.

#### 6. Reward Function Definition
The reward function should be clearly articulated to reflect both energy efficiency and occupant comfort. A possible formulation could be:

\[
R(s,a) = w_1 \cdot E(s,a) - w_2 \cdot D(s)
\]

Where:
- \( E(s,a) \) represents the energy consumption associated with action \( a \) in state \( s \).
- \( D(s) \) represents the deviation from the desired comfort range.
- \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \) are weights that can be adjusted based on the importance of energy efficiency versus comfort.

#### 7. State Estimation Using Variational Free Energy
Variational Free Energy (VFE) is a technique for approximating posterior distributions in probabilistic models. In the context of POMDPs, VFE can be utilized to estimate the latent states based on the observations received. This involves:

- Defining a prior distribution over the latent states.
- Updating this distribution based on the observed data using Bayes' theorem.
- Minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximate posterior and the true posterior, which corresponds to minimizing the VFE.

An implementation plan could involve using a Variational Inference method, such as Expectation-Maximization (EM), to optimize the parameters of the model iteratively.

#### 8. Action Selection Using Expected Free Energy
Expected Free Energy (EFE) is a criterion for action selection that aims to minimize future uncertainty while maximizing expected rewards. In the thermal homeostasis context, EFE can guide the selection of control actions by considering:

- The expected outcome of each action given the current state and observations.
- The uncertainty associated with the latent states and how it can be reduced through action.

By selecting actions that minimize EFE, the system can effectively manage temperature while also considering the comfort of occupants.

#### Conclusion
The proposed POMDP framework for thermal homeostasis integrates control states, latent states, and observation levels to create a robust model for managing indoor temperature. By employing Variational Free Energy for state estimation and Expected Free Energy for action selection, the research aims to develop an adaptive and efficient thermal control system. Future work will involve implementing the model and conducting experiments to validate its performance in real-world scenarios.
